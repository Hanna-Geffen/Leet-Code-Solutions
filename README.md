<h3 align="center">My LeetCode Solutions for Interview Preparation</h3>

This GitHub repository contains my solutions to a variety of coding exercises from **LeetCode**, a popular platform for interview preparation. 
<!---
These solutions are implemented in various programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and more, and are designed to help you prepare for technical interviews.
--->

The repository includes a diverse range of LeetCode problems, covering different topics such as **data structures** (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.), **algorithms** (e.g., **sorting, searching, dynamic programming**, etc.), and other common interview topics (e.g., **string manipulation**, **bitwise operations**, etc.).

<!---
Each solution is thoroughly **documented** with comments explaining the approach, **time and space complexity**, and any trade-offs made. The solutions are organized in folders based on problem categories, making it easy to navigate and find specific problem solutions.

Whether you're a student, a coding enthusiast, or someone preparing for a technical interview, this repository can serve as a valuable resource for honing your coding skills and mastering LeetCode problems. Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from the implementations, and use them as a reference for your own interview preparation.
